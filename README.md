The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in heavy loss of life of passengers and crew. One of the reasons for heavy loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for all. Although there was some element of luck involved in survival, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

This is a small sample of the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.
